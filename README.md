# Length-of-Stay-in-Hospital
Analyzed the data of various patients and the information about the different factors like vitamins, sodium levels, BIM and body energy and predicted the length of stay for the patient according to this factors. Used regression methods like linear and logistics and Tree based model to predict so. I used R studio to perform all the analysis.
